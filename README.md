Main Language: Python:
Section 2 of the main programming team :)

Notice: Before running q_learning_redtie.py, first run setup.py.
To run q_learning_redtie.py, type cd ReinforcementLearning, then cd model, then cd RedTieBot, then type python3 q_learning_redtie.py (or type q_le and then press tab) - This should work for all; if it doesn't, we'll add updates.
